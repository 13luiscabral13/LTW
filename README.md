## Evaluation

Each group member commit number does not directly correlate to his/hers contribution in the project, therefore, should not be taken into account when evaluating the group.

## Aditional Information

It may happen that the pictures aren't displayed in the site. In the case of uploading a dish picture, it is due to a path error not found in time. The pictures can always be displayed if inserted in the paste dishPics.
It has been a reccuring error for the pictures that are present in the index to not be correctly displayed once a git pull is completed. We have come to the conclusion that this is merely a Visual Studio related error, being easily fixable when the pictures are introduced again in the correct folder.
Due to a lapse, the folder profilePics was not created in this final commit. Despite the fact that the pictures were not being shown in a completely, correct way, we want to address that that error was not generated, to our knowledge, because of the folder unexistance. 
In case one wants to checkout a restaurant page from its owners point of view, without creating a restaurant, through the website, by checking out the final attribute of the SQL lines 140, 141, 142, 143, one can see which user owns which restaurant. 1 being the first created, 2 being the second and so on.
